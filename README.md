# Git Search App

### Author: Kelvin 

This is a prrogram that helps a user search for users on github and gives them a direct link to it.

## Getting Started
Have a review of my Github account and visit the Repository.
https://github.com/Kariuki62/searchme1

### Prerequisites

You must install angular CLI to view this app and the best angular to use is either angular 6 to the latest versions in the market .

## Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine from the **[online repository]
https://github.com/Kariuki62/searchme1.git

If you already have git and angular installed in your machine continue to the next step,

If you do not have angular in your system you can visit (https://angular.io) and get the installation process and you will find some commands you can use on your terminal.

If you are not conversant on the usage of git you can visit https://github.com and clear guidelines on how to use git are outlined.

### Development server
```
If you are an angular 6 user you can run this command incase the `ng serve. First run this command npm install typescript@">=3.1.1 <3.3.0".
Run `ng serve --port 4217` for a dev server. Navigate to https://http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
```

### Code scaffolding
```
Run `ng generate component  to generate a new component(you can use any name of your choice.).
```
### Further help
```
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
```
